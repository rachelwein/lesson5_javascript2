### Project Description:
In this assignment, I modified the tax calculator application which computes a user's total income tax and displays the tax bracket the user is in. In order for the application to make these decisions, I used if, if/else and nested if statements. I also defined event handlers. I used the 2016 IRS tax bracket to help me fill in the correct values for each status.

### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. Decision making is the process of determining the order in which statements execute a program. 
2. The "if" statement is the most common type of decision making statement and it is used to execute specific programming code. 
3. A case label represents a specific value. When a switch statement executes, the value that is returned by the expression is then compared to each case label.
